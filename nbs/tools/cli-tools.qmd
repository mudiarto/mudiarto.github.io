# CLI Tools/Links (wip)

List of the tools that I use, and the configurations in the dotfiles.



## dotfiles

I have a huge set of configurations on my private repo, built over the years, but it is not very organized.
I want to cleanup and make it public so I can clone it easily when I work on a new terminal.
The old config files are based on [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/stow.html),
and I want to change it to use [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/)
