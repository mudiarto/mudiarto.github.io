# ML/AI Tools/Links

Links and my comments on tools that I found interesting around the web - in no particular orders

## Refs:
- [Mudiarto ML/AI stars](https://github.com/stars/mudiarto/lists/ml-ai) - My collection of ML/AI stars as I stumbled upon them

## Tools I use
- TBD


### Jupyter
- I am deciding between [marimo](https://marimo.io/) and jupyter for doing my ML/AI learning. Marimo seems good,
  but for now, it seems jupyter is more standard and more supported. So I will use Jupyter for now, and probably
  experiment with marimo later

- I am experimenting with [jupyter-ai](https://jupyter-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
  - installation was straightforward
  - [jupyter-ai experiment notebook](https://github.com/mudiarto/ml-notebooks/blob/dev/notebooks/misc/test-jupyter-ai.ipynb)


### MLFlow
- I want to be able to keep track of my experiment instead of doing it randomly. 

## Tools that seems useful
- TBD
