# My dotfiles story (wip)

**link to my dotfiles: <https://github.com/mudiarto/dotfiles>**

I love to tinker with my environment, since I love playing with shiny tools,
and hopefully to increase my productivity.

I have a growing collections of cli tools, scripts, and configurations that I
have been building over the years, but they are not very organized. They are
also in private repository so it is a bit hard to pull when I work on new 
environment.

I want to make it more organized, and make it public so I can use it across
different machines. I want to make my computer setup like cattle, not pets.

This is [my current dotfiles repository](https://github.com/mudiarto/dotfiles) 
in github. I will try to document the process/thoughts of how I setup my
dotfiles here while I'm rebuilding it from scratch.

## Tools used

### [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/)

I used to manage my dotfiles using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/),
but it is a bit hard to manage with different machines and OS. It seems that
chezmoi is trying to solve this problem. I will give it a try.

### [xonsh](https://xon.sh/) 

I used to use zsh, but I never comfortable doing scripting in it. I want to 
experiment with xonsh as my shell, since it is python based, and seems to be
more powerful & flexible.

The interesting things about xonsh is that it has 2 modes, python mode and 
shell mode. My initial confusion is to differentiate which mode it is in,
and also the string manipulation between python and shell mode.

Once I got the hang of it, I really enjoy using it.

Couple notes/issues that I encountered:

- Install it using mamba to have a stable installation that doesn't depend on OS
  - see: <https://github.com/anki-code/xonsh-install?tab=readme-ov-file#mamba-install-xonsh>
- [Mutagen sync issue]()
  because of anything printed during startup in xonsh will be returned to ssh, which cause this issue:
  "mutagen Error: server handshake failed: unable to receive client magic number: EOF"
  - similar to [this issue](https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen/issues/333)
  - [My patchy solution is to log it with debug level](https://github.com/mudiarto/dotfiles/blob/f91660e058014983746425ed0170dba1a5056e03/dot_config/xonsh/rc.xsh#L11C1-L16C88)
- VI mode give this error when I cut something in command line:
  `Pyperclip could not find a copy/paste mechanism for your system.`
  - the reason it happens is because I run xonsh remotely via ssh, and there is no X11 window to use as clipboard.
  - I tried couple things (including installing Xquartz in my mac) which didn't solve the issue
  - [My solution is to disable the clipboard](https://github.com/mudiarto/dotfiles/blob/f91660e058014983746425ed0170dba1a5056e03/dot_xonshrc#L29-L41)
